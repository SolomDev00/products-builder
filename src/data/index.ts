    title: "2024 Volvo XC90",
    description: `On its own, the 2024 Volvo XC90 has a lot going for it. It's the largest SUV in the Swedish carmaker's portfolio, it's available as an efficient plug-in hybrid, and it's elegantly styled inside and out. With Volvo's fanatical devotion to safety tech, it's also a strong pick for growing families, but it's starting to show its age after eight years without a redesign. Still, even with nearly imperceptible changes this year (new wheels for the plug-in Recharge model), the XC90 remains one of the better luxury SUVs not from Germany, especially in plug-in hybrid form.`,

    title: "2024 BMW iX",
    description: `The 2024 BMW iX is among the top-rated all-electric luxury SUVs, and for good reason. It's about the same size as the automaker's midsize X5 and stands out with its roomy seating and impressive power and range. Even the entry-level xDrive50 has two electric motors, all-wheel drive, 516 horsepower, and more than 300 miles of range. Alternatively, you can pick the M60 version that dials up 610 hp and can rocket from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds.`,

    title: "2023 Ford Mustang Mach-E",
    description: `If you asked us a decade ago what other vehicle we thought might be graced by the storied Mustang nameplate, we never would've guessed an all-electric SUV. But the 2023 Ford Mustang Mach-E is exactly that, and while it's not related in any mechanical way to the iconic Mustang two-door sports car, it inherits many design cues and offers a sporty driving experience befitting a car wearing the galloping horse badge.`,

    title: "2023 Kia Rio",
    description: `One of the smartest decisions you could make when buying a car is to get the smallest vehicle that meets your needs. Subcompact sedans and hatchbacks are some of the smallest you could get today, but they're often overlooked by shoppers who have their hearts seemingly stuck on SUVs. That's too bad because these small cars offer more versatility than you might expect, along with better fuel economy and a smaller footprint that's easier to maneuver.`,

    title: "2024 Honda Civic",
    description: `The current-generation Honda Civic is one of the automaker's best yet. In fact, our test team named the Civic the Edmunds Top Rated Car for 2023. Just about everything you'd want from a small sedan or hatchback is here, including plenty of interior room, pleasing performance, and nearly all of the latest technology and driver assist features Honda has on offer. There's even the high-performance 315-horsepower Type R version to satisfy driving enthusiasts. So what's in store for the 2024 Civic? If this were a movie, we'd title it "Return of the Hybrid."`,

    title: "2024 BMW X3",
    description: `The BMW X3 is a small luxury SUV positioned between the X1 and X5 in the Bavarian automaker's lineup. It offers seating for five and strikes a careful balance of sportiness, comfort and utility. If you like the interior design and tech features of your 3 Series sedan but need more space for road trips, chances are you'll like the X3. BMW updated the X3 in 2022, and the SUV soldiers on into 2024 mostly unchanged.`,

    title: "2023 Volkswagen Golf GTI",
    description: `In 1983, the original hot hatch made its way to America. The first Volkswagen was a hopped-up version of the Rabbit, complete with a more powerful engine and sport-tuned suspension wrapped in an affordable, practical package. It was a hit and spawned all manner of imitators, though the GTI itself is as strong as ever. Forty years after it was introduced, the 2023 Volkswagen Golf GTI and more powerful Volkswagen Golf R (reviewed separately) are the only Golf variants still on sale in America. The biggest news for this year is a special 40th Anniversary Edition trim, which is limited to just 1,500 units for 2023.`,
